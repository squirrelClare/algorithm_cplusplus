Chinese foreign policy has made some adjustments in recent years. Central Asia is receiving more attention from Beijing. China's local diplomacy has started to shift much of its focus on this area, where Chinese President Xi Jinping made a State visit in September 2013 and reiterated the concept of a "Silk Road economic belt," to boost the prosperity of Central Asia and China's western areas.
